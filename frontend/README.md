# Frontend placeholder

This folder will host the Justice Made Clear web UI. During the prototype it focuses on:
- Uploading documents (text, PDF, image) and calling POST /process_document.
- Displaying the original document, simplified explanation, and four-block legal guide.
- Showing safety warnings coming from the backend.

The UI must be mobile-first/responsive and avoid implementing any legal logic. All reasoning lives in the backend; the frontend only orchestrates calls and renders results.
